This is my final project at physics engineering major, Gadjah Mada University. The title of my final Project is Planning and Design Toe Blood Pressure Measurement System - Based on Photoplethysmography for Peripheral Arterial Disease Early Detection. This repository This repository contains programs used on personal computers with the main programming language, Python. In addition, the following is an electrical drawing of this system.

The Controller used is i.e. Arduino Nano. Basiclly, data acquisition using microcontroller for acquire the raw data from PPG Sensor. The program i used for the microcontroller and aquire the raw data from the sensor can be accessed via the following link [ArduinoMAX30100 by oxullo](https://github.com/oxullo/Arduino-MAX30100.git). Credit for Oxullo, thanks for your help in my final project.
